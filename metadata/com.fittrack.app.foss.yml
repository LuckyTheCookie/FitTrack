Summary: Privacy-first offline fitness tracker

Description: |-
  FitTrack is your elegant, privacy-first fitness companion that works 100% offline.
  
  <b>PRIVACY & PHILOSOPHY</b>
  Because your health data belongs to YOU, FitTrack was designed to be completely transparent:
  * 100% Local & Offline: Works without internet. Your data stays on your device.
  * Secure Camera: Used only for real-time movement detection in Rep Counter. No images are saved or sent.
  * Accelerometer Alternative: Privacy-conscious? Use sensor-only mode to count reps without the camera.
  * Optional Social Features: Social features are completely optional. You stay in control.
  * Complete Deletion: One-click account deletion removes all your data instantly.
  * No Data Selling: Never. This is a passion project, not a commercial product.
  
  <b>MAIN FEATURES</b>
  
  Dashboard & Tracking:
  * Today Screen: Synthetic view with weekly progress ring and calendar
  * Complete Tracking: 4 dedicated modes (Home Workout, Running, Meals, Measurements)
  * History: Full journal with filters and quick deletion
  * Health Connect (Android): Smart automatic import of your workouts from other apps
  
  Intelligent Rep Counter:
  Put down your phone and let AI work for you:
  * Detection: Analysis via Camera (local Pose Detection) or Accelerometer
  * Exercises: Support for Push-ups, Squats, Sit-ups, Jumping Jacks
  * Feedback: Smooth animations and visual coaching
  
  Tools & Gamification:
  * Workout Generator: Create custom workouts (Duration, Focus, Intensity)
  * Streak System: Maintain your streak to unlock visual rewards
  * Badges: 10+ trophies to unlock (From "First Step" to "Legend")
